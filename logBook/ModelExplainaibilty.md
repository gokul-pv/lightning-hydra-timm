## Model Explainability

Model explainability refers to the concept of being able to understand the machine learning model. For example â€“ if a healthcare model is predicting whether a patient is suffering from a particular disease or not. The medical practitioners need to know what parameters the model is taking into account or if the model contains any bias.

### Why is Model Explainability required?

- Being able to interpret a model increases trust in a machine-learning model. This becomes all the more important in scenarios involving life-and-death situations like healthcare, law, credit lending, etc.
- Once we understand a model, we can detect if there is any bias present in the model.
- Model explainability becomes important while debugging a model during the development phase.

### Description

In this experiment, I try to explain pre-trained model from timm using the following methods

- [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365) (Click [here](https://erdem.pl/2022/04/xai-methods-integrated-gradients) for more)
- Noise Tunnel
- Saliency
- [Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901)
- SHAP
- [GradCAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391)
- [GradCAM++](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~mlerma/papers/Grad_CAM___is_equivalent_to_Grad_CAM_with_positive_gradients.pdf)

I also try to test the robustness of model by creating some adversarial samples and augmented images.

- [Projected Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)
- [Fast Gradient Sign Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)
- Pixel Dropout
- Random Noise
- Random Brightness

### How to run

```python
# For model explanation, run
python src/explain.py

# For testing model robustness, run
python src/robustness.py
```

### Results

The results obtained from the above-mentioned methods for model explainability are shown below:
